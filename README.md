## What?

In this project, me and my colleagues had fun playing with a WPA2 Enterprise network architecture that we setup in order to apply a real life chain of attack. First **deauth attack**, then **evil twin attac**k and once inside the network, a **DNS spoofing attack**.

We took as reference the paper [METTER PAPER] which performed several different attacks on a wider network architecure, closer to an enterprise one.

## Introduction
This project aims to examine the paper **”Empirical Evaluation of Attacks
Against IEEE 802.11 Enterprise Networks: The AWID3 Dataset”**, which
analyzes the vulnerabilities of the IEEE 802.11 protocol, with a specific focus on
attacks conducted in environments protected by security mechanisms such as Pro-
tected Management Frames (PMF) introduced with the IEEE 802.11w.
The first phase (Paper Review) of the project involves an analysis of the paper,
with particular attention to the types of attacks analyzed, and their implications
for the security of enterprise Wi-Fi networks. Subsequently, some of the attacks
described in the paper are reproduced to assess their impact and effectiveness on
protected networks, aiming to understand the level of security provided by current
protection measures.
